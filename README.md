# Traffic-Signs-Classification
A Deep learning model to classify traffic signs for self driving cars.


# Objectives
In this project, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:
1.	Understand the theory and intuition behind Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
2.	Import Key python libraries, dataset and perform image visualization.
3.	Perform image normalization and convert images from color-scaled to gray-scaled.
4.	Build a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a back-end.
5.	Compile and fit Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to training data.
6.	Assess the performance of trained Convolutional Neural Network model and ensure its generalization using various KPIs.
